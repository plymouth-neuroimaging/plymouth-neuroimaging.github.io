### Summary
Stroke is the most common neurological disease and the most common cause of disability in the UK and worldwide. A number of treatments (such as lowering blood pressure or taking blood thinners) have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, however some of the factors that lead to stroke are not yet clear. Using ECGs, brain scans, heart scans, laboratory test results and medical records, we aim to automatically generate estimates of the risk of stroke in the near future. The project will, we hope, reveal previously unknown factors which lead to stroke. We hope to integrate it into GP systems in order to inform decisions about treatment aimed at reducing future stroke risk.
