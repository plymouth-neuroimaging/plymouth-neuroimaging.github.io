### Summary
Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. There are currently a number of promising drugs being developed which aim to slow down the progression of the disease. The earlier such drugs are given, the more likely that they will be able to prevent life changing disability occurring. 
There is emerging evidence that changes associated with parkinson’s disease can be picked up on MRI brain scans. This project aims to understand whether MRI brain scan collected for other purposes can be used to distinguish people with parkinson’s from controls, either after or before the diagnosis is made.
