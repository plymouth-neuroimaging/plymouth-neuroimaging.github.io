Prospective neuroprotective treatments for PD are highlighting the need for
early diagnostic tests. MRI is not currently considered a robust imaging test
but exploratory techniques have suggested that dedicated experimental sequences
may be able to detect early pathological brain changes.

We explored whether such changes might be detectable in routine MRI scans by
employing deep learning (DL) methods. This subset of machine learning has
recently shown great promise in diagnostic medical imaging, with its potential
to detect patterns invisible to the human eye. Emerging explainability methods
are allowing DL predictions to be better interpreted.

The Atypical Parkinsonian Syndromes Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Multiple System Atrophy and Corticobasal Syndrome are rapidly progressive neurological conditions with a poor prognosis. Initially they may present almost identically to Parkinson’s disease. A number of promising treatments to slow down or halt the progression of these diseases are currently being tested in drug trials. Using Artificial Intelligence, we aim to train a model to identify features on MRI brain scans which may allow earlier diagnosis of three conditions from Parkinson’s disease.
