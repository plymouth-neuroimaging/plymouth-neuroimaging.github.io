        {% capture intro_michael_allen %}
        Mike is a Senior Research Fellow in Applied Healthcare Modelling and
        Data Science in the University of Exeter Medical School. After nearly
        20 years in Pharma R&D Drug Discovery, he switched to academia to focus
        on research that maximises NHS benefits from new treatments. He has a
        life-long interest in combining biomedical and computer sciences, and
        believes we're now living in the age that he so looked forward to -
        where computer science ('AI') is matching biomedical science in what it
        can offer to medicine.

        Currently his work mostly involves looking at variation in healthcare
        between hospitals, looking at what different hospitals do differently,
        and how that affects patient outcomes. He uses modelling and AI to ask
        the question "What would happen if my patient went to another hospital?
        What would they do, and what would the patient outcome be?"

        Veljanoski AFHEA BSc (Hons) MBBS MRCS</a> is an NIHR Academic Clinical
        Fellow at the UoP and Specialty Trainee (NTN) in Neurosurgery at the
        UHPNT South West Neurosurgery Centre. He is developing a radiomics
        pipeline that applies machine learning techniques to the pre-operative
        MRI scans of patients with brain tumours. Predicting the biological
        tumour characteristics from imaging has the potential to risk-stratify
        patients and guide treatment decisions. He has completed an MSc module
        in Advanced Machine Learning and has attended a leading, international
        radiomics workshop.
