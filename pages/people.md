        <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/mark-thurston">Dr Mark
        Thurston</a> is a consultant radiologist with an interest in medical
        imaging applications of computer vision techniques. He has published
        numerous peer-reviewed publications on categorisation of medical
        imaging investigations including CT, X-rays and nuclear medicine scans.
        He is a member of the <a

        href="https://www.plymouthhospitals.nhs.uk/neurology">University
        Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust</a>. Much of his research career has been
        spent predicting and stratifying risk of Parkinsonâ€™s disease using
        clinical and genomic biomarkers. His work now focuses on risk
        stratification and early diagnosis of a range of neurological diseases
        based on routinely collected data, including an <a
        href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/">UKRI MRC</a> supported
        project which aims to stratify future risk of <a
        href="https://plymouth-neuroimaging.github.io/projects/2023/10/11/stroke.html">stroke</a>.
        He is a member of the Health Research Authority <a

        <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/megan-courtman">Megan</a> is
        a data scientist interested in using explainable AI to solve problems
        in healthcare. Her ongoing PhD research focuses on applying machine
        learning to medical imaging. She has built deep learning models to
        differentiate between Parkinson's and control MRI brain scans with high
        accuracy. She has also worked on computer vision models for medical
        safety applications and natural language processing models for
        radiology research dataset curation. Her work has won the <a

        {% capture intro_michael_allen %}
        Mike is a Senior Research Fellow in Applied Healthcare Modelling and
        Data Science in the University of Exeter Medical School. After nearly
        20 years in Pharma R&D Drug Discovery, he switched to academia to focus
        on research that maximises NHS benefits from new treatments. He has a
        life-long interest in combining biomedical and computer sciences, and
        believes we're now living in the age that he so looked forward to -
        where computer science ('AI') is matching biomedical science in what it
        can offer to medicine.

        Currently his work mostly involves looking at variation in healthcare
        between hospitals, looking at what different hospitals do differently,
        and how that affects patient outcomes. He uses modelling and AI to ask
        the question "What would happen if my patient went to another hospital?
        What would they do, and what would the patient outcome be?"

        {% capture intro_damjan_veljanoski %}
        Mr Damjan Veljanoski AFHEA BSc (Hons) MBBS MRCS is an NIHR Academic
        Clinical Fellow at the University of Plymouth and Specialty Trainee
        (NTN) in Neurosurgery at the South West Neurosurgery Centre in
        Plymouth. He is developing a radiomics pipeline that applies machine
        learning techniques to the pre-operative MRI scans of patients with
        brain tumours. Predict the biological tumour characteristics from
        imaging has the potential to risk-stratify patients and guide treatment
        decisions. He has completed an MSc module in Advanced Machine Learning
        and has attended a leading, international radiomics workshop. He is
        enthusiastic to foster research collaborations.
