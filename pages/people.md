        {% capture intro_stephen_mullin %}
            Dr Mullin is Associate Professor of Neurology at the 
            <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/stephen-mullin">University of Plymouth (UoP)</a> 
                and Consultant Neurologist at <a href="https://www.plymouthhospitals.nhs.uk/neurology">University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust</a>. Much of his research career has been spent predicting and stratifying risk of Parkinsonâ€™s disease using clinical and genomic biomarkers. His work now focuses on risk stratification and early diagnosis of a range of neurological diseases based on routinely collected data, including an <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/">UKRI MRC</a> supported project which aims to stratify future risk of <a href="https://plymouth-neuroimaging.github.io/projects/2023/10/11/stroke.html">stroke</a>. He is a member of the Health Research Authority <a href="https://www.hra.nhs.uk/about-us/committees-and-services/confidentiality-advisory-group/">Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG)</a> and the NIHR <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm">Health Technology Assessment</a>  Advisory Group. He is the UoP Faculty of Health lead for the group.

        {% capture intro_megan_courtman %}
            <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/megan-courtman">Megan</a> is a data scientist
            interested in using explainable AI to solve problems in healthcare. Her ongoing PhD research
            focuses on applying machine learning to medical imaging. She has built deep learning models to
            differentiate between Parkinson's and control MRI brain scans with high accuracy. She has also
            worked on computer vision models for medical safety applications and natural language processing
            models for radiology research dataset curation. Her work has won the <a
                href="https://www.theabn.org/">Association of British Neurologists</a> prize for best poster
            and the University of Plymouth (<a

        {% capture intro_michael_allen %}
            I am a Senior Research Fellow in Applied Healthcare Modelling and Data Science in the University of Exeter Medical School. After nearly 20 years in Pharma R&D Drug Discovery, I switched to academia to focus on research that maximises NHS benefits from new treatments. I have had a life-long interest in combining biomedical and computer sciences, and think we're now living in the age that I so looked forward to - where computer science ('AI') is matching biomedical science in what it can offer to medicine.

            Currently I work mostly in looking at variation in healthcare between hospitals, looking at what different hospitals do differently, and how that affects patient outcomes. I use modelling and AI to ask the question "What would happen if my patient went to another hospital? What would they do, and what would the patient outcome be?"
