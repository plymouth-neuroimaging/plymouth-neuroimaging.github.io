        {% capture intro_stephen_mullin %}
            Dr Mullin is Associate Professor of Neurology at the 
            <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/stephen-mullin">University of Plymouth (UoP)</a> 
                and Consultant Neurologist at <a href="https://www.plymouthhospitals.nhs.uk/neurology">University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust</a>. Much of his research career has been spent predicting and stratifying risk of Parkinsonâ€™s disease using clinical and genomic biomarkers. His work now focuses on risk stratification and early diagnosis of a range of neurological diseases based on routinely collected data, including an <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/">UKRI MRC</a> supported project which aims to stratify future risk of <a href="https://plymouth-neuroimaging.github.io/projects/2023/10/11/stroke.html">stroke</a>. He is a member of the Health Research Authority <a href="https://www.hra.nhs.uk/about-us/committees-and-services/confidentiality-advisory-group/">Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG)</a> and the NIHR <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm">Health Technology Assessment</a>  Advisory Group. He is the UoP Faculty of Health lead for the group.

        {% capture intro_megan_courtman %}
            <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/megan-courtman">Megan</a> is a data scientist
            interested in using explainable AI to solve problems in healthcare. Her ongoing PhD research
            focuses on applying machine learning to medical imaging. She has built deep learning models to
            differentiate between Parkinson's and control MRI brain scans with high accuracy. She has also
            worked on computer vision models for medical safety applications and natural language processing
            models for radiology research dataset curation. Her work has won the <a
                href="https://www.theabn.org/">Association of British Neurologists</a> prize for best poster
            and the University of Plymouth (<a
